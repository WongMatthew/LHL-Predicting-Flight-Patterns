# LHL Midterm Proejct: Predicting-Flight-Patterns

**Authors: Prashanta Saha & Matt Wong**

The main goal of this project is to predict the flight delays from the first 7 days of 2020

## ========================= Contents =========================

### ======================= ReadMe Files & Guide Notebooks =======================
These files were provided to us at the beginning of the project:

* **[exploratory_analysis.ipynb]():** The exploratory data analysis contains 10 questions that we needed to answer during the data exploration phase. It helped us get familiar with the variables and dataset. 
* **[data_description.md]():** Contains the description of all variables across 4 tables in the dataset.
* **[modeling.ipynb]():** Contains the instructions for modeling parts of the project. 
* **[sample_submission.csv]():** Example of the model that is to be submitted 

### ============================ Data Manipulation ============================

These were the files we used to clean and manipulate data, and engineer features:

### =============================== Modelling ===============================

These files contain the various models we used:

## Data

We were provided with 4 tables of data from the air travel industry

1. **flights**
2. **passengers**
3. **fuel_consumption**
4. **flights_test**
